# Klic - Next-Gen Input Visualizer for macOS

Klic is a modern, minimal input visualization app for macOS that displays keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, and mouse movements in a beautiful overlay at the bottom center of the screen. Designed with a next-gen aesthetic inspired by Vercel, Linear, and Apple, Klic provides streamers, presenters, and educators with an elegant way to showcase their inputs.
