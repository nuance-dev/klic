# Klic - Next-Gen Input Visualizer for macOS

## Overview
Klic is a modern, minimal input visualization app for macOS that displays keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, and mouse movements in a beautiful overlay at the bottom center of the screen. Designed with a next-gen aesthetic inspired by Vercel, Linear, and Apple, Klic provides streamers, presenters, and educators with an elegant way to showcase their inputs.

## Core Features

### 1. Keyboard Visualization
- Real-time display of keyboard inputs with elegant animations
- Special visualization for modifier keys (Command, Option, Shift, Control)
- Combination shortcuts displayed with connecting lines/animations
- Minimal, clean typography for key labels
- Subtle animations for keypress and release

### 2. Trackpad Visualization
- Multi-touch finger position tracking displayed as subtle dots/rings
- Gesture recognition and visualization (pinch, swipe, rotate)
- Pressure sensitivity visualization through opacity/size
- Finger identification (which finger is touching where)

### 3. Mouse Visualization
- Cursor position tracking with elegant trail effect
- Click visualization (left, right, middle buttons)
- Scroll wheel actions displayed as directional indicators
- Mouse movement speed represented through trail intensity

### 4. UI/UX Design Principles
- Floating overlay with adjustable opacity
- Dark mode with subtle accent colors
- Minimal, distraction-free design
- Adaptive sizing based on screen resolution
- Intelligent positioning to avoid obscuring content

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Input Monitoring System**
   - `KeyboardMonitor`: Captures keyboard events using macOS APIs
   - `TrackpadMonitor`: Tracks multi-touch events and gestures
   - `MouseMonitor`: Monitors cursor position, clicks, and scroll actions

2. **Visualization Layer**
   - `KeyboardVisualizer`: Renders keyboard inputs with animations
   - `TrackpadVisualizer`: Displays touch positions and gestures
   - `MouseVisualizer`: Shows cursor movements and actions
   - `OverlayManager`: Handles positioning and transparency

3. **Settings & Configuration**
   - User preferences for appearance and behavior
   - Preset configurations for different use cases

### Technical Requirements

1. **System Access**
   - Accessibility permissions for input monitoring
   - Screen recording permissions for overlay positioning

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Low CPU/GPU usage to minimize impact on other applications
   - Efficient rendering using Metal/SwiftUI
   - Minimal memory footprint

3. **Compatibility**
   - macOS 12.0+ (Monterey and newer)
   - Support for Apple Silicon and Intel processors

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up window management for overlay
- Implement basic keyboard event monitoring
- Create initial UI framework

### Phase 2: Keyboard Visualization
- Design and implement key press visualization
- Add support for modifier keys and combinations
- Create animations for key press/release

### Phase 3: Trackpad Integration
- Implement trackpad event monitoring
- Design touch visualization interface
- Add gesture recognition and display

### Phase 4: Mouse Visualization
- Add mouse position tracking
- Implement click and scroll visualization
- Create movement trails and effects

### Phase 5: Polish & Refinement
- Optimize performance
- Add user settings and customization
- Final UI refinements and animations

## Design Language

- **Typography**: SF Pro Display, clean and minimal
- **Color Palette**: Dark background (#121212) with accent colors
- **Animations**: Subtle, fluid transitions with spring physics
- **Shapes**: Rounded rectangles with subtle shadows
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, golden ratio proportions

## Success Metrics
- Minimal CPU usage (<5% on average)
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Intuitive visualization that clearly communicates input actions
- Elegant, non-distracting presence on screen
